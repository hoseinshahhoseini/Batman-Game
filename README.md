**Gotham Night Patrol – Unity Project**

This project is a simple night-patrol simulation inspired by Batman. I built it to practice basic movement control, state management, lighting, and sound effects in Unity. The project is focused on creating a small playable scene with clear and organized scripts.

**Main Features**

Character or Batmobile movement with keyboard controls

Two movement speeds: normal and boost (Shift)

Three states: Normal, Stealth, and Alert

Stealth reduces speed and lights

Alert activates flashing lights and an alarm sound

Bat-Signal that can be turned on/off with the B key and slowly rotates in the sky

**Controls**

**W/A/S/D – Move**

**Shift – Boost**

**C – Stealth**

**Space – Alert**

**B – Toggle Bat-Signal**

**Project Structure**

Movement, state handling, lighting, and audio are separated into different scripts to keep the project clean and easy to understand. The logic of each part is explained with simple comments.

**How to Run**

Clone the project, open it in Unity, load the main scene, and press Play.

**Summary**

The project demonstrates basic gameplay mechanics, simple state changes, dynamic lights, sound effects, and clean organization suitable for a beginner-intermediate Unity project.
